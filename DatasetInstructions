As the datasets are very large, we have provided a script to generate shuffled streams on the fly and instructions to generate the streams from the UCI originals.

Please download the original datasets from the UCI repository. The WISDM (raw) dataset can be obtained from http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php

All datasets should be converted to CSV's if they are already not CSV's. Where data is split into multiple files, please concatenate the files. For instance, PAMAP2 has 9 files, one per subject, and HAR has 4 files, divided by device.

The gas sensor dataset requires id's to be mapped to their corresponding classes, and then the id column to be deleted, because there is a many-one mapping from id's to classes.

CSV's should be converted to ARFF format. This can be done manually or by using the MOA converter as below.

java -cp moa.jar moa.DoTask CSV2Arff -i input.csv -o output.arff

Once this is done, separate the head of the ARFF (metadata) from the tail (data), and store the files in the folder structure indicated in the Python script.

The script will handle all the shuffling, experimental runs, and chart-making.

Simply uncomment the charts you would like to generate and run the script.
